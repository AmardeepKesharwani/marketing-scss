### What is SCSS
SCSS : Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet is the superset of CSS. SCSS is the more advanced version of CSS. SCSS was designed by Hampton Catlin and was developed by Chris Eppstein and Natalie Weizenbaum. Due to its advanced features it is often termed as Sassy CSS. SCSS have file extension of .scss.

### CSS or SCSS – Which is better?
CSS is the styling language which is used to style web pages and it is understandable by the browser. Using SCSS, we can add many additional functionality to CSS such as variables, nesting and more. All these additional functionalities can make writing CSS much easier and faster as compared to writing the traditional CSS. SCSS produce a traditional CSS that the browser can understand by running the SCSS files on the server running your web app.

### Advantages of using SCSS?
SCSS is more expressive
We can compress several lines of code in SASS syntax into much less number of lines of SCSS. In SCSS, the standard lines can also be compressed when I’m doing something complicated and can be expanded again for reference.

It encourages proper nesting of rules
If you use the comma operator at a high level, it increases the file size of the final CSS. This can result in making the code really hard to perform overriding of rules.

SCSS allows the user to write better inline documentation
SASS is flexible with comments, but any good developer will prefer inline documentation which is available in SCSS. Inline documentation makes the lines of code self explanatory.

Integrating existing CSS tools and CSS codebase is much easier
Syntax highlighting widely used CSS tool and is supported in SCSS. SCSS allows you use the existing code, and help improve its internal structure without altering the external behavior of the code.
